## About me

For a long time I thought a blog represented an individual's "token" on the Internet. We use the token to label us and surf on the Internet. Many people list their interests, faith and relevant information on the `/about` page to capture people's attention.

But there are some differences here. I don't want to disclose my personal information.

In order for you to understand this person, oh no, it might be an octopus in a deep sea! I will convey its meaning to you as a translator of Octopus Language:

This is an octopus, but its true form is the bubbles spit out by the octopus. Therefore, it often refers to itself as `Bubbles`. If you manage to catch this octopus in real life, you can also call it `Bubbles`(Or a more friendly pronunciation, `Pop out` without pronouncing `t`).

This octopus has a strange ID: `iGxnon`, which has no pronunciation, and its origin cannot be verified. It is just that the young one needs to give its MC account a name that looks more pleasing than [xddcc](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDigitalCircus/comments/17v0rdb/what_does_xddcc_mean/).

This octopus likes to lie on the coral and daydream. Its reactions are always slow, but this is just a disguise to avoid the sight of sharks in the deep sea. In fact, it is very delicate and always worries that the mucus secreted by its tentacles will dirty other fish's skirts. However, some clumsy crabs on the seabed often mistake it for a motionless coral and cannot control their pincers from poking at it, which makes it very distressed. At the same time, it is also afraid of being truly ignored as if it were just another piece of coral.

This octopus often fantasizes about being a highly skilled professional guitarist, just like Squidward in "SpongeBob SquarePants" imagining himself as a musician. While playing, it tends to tangle its tentacles and produce discordant sounds on the guitar. Despite this, it has never given up.

This octopus has been surfing in the digital world since it was young, touching [elephants](https://www.php.net/) on virtual land, tasting [coffee](https://www.java.com/), grabbing some [pythons](https://www.python.org/) to scare the [gopher](https://go.dev/) hiding in caves. Now it has forgotten the shape of elephant ears, the taste of coffee, and the hissing sound of pythons, but it can still recall how gopher shiver in fear inside caves. Oh, there is also its new friend [ferris](https://rustacean.net/), a small crab covered in spikes. It records its experiences with these new and old friends in a book called [Github](https://github.com/iGxnon), which was given to it by an [octocat](https://octodex.github.com/). ("Is this an octopus or a cat?")

What? Do you want to know what this octopus looks like? This is its upper body:

> Octocat: Meow

The cruel ocean woke up this octopus as if from a dream, hastily making plans for the future. "What will the future be like? Will I be swallowed by a shark in one bite, or will I stand on the ocean's stage and play guitar to my heart's content?" it thought.

The story of this octopus named `Bubbles` continues...

## About this site

As you can see, this is a minimalist website that may seem a bit rudimentary, but I surprisingly love it. I dislike complex and bloated designs, preferring simple yet efficient interfaces. I believe that the essence of a blog should be its content, without the need for fancy CSS and JS to dress up special effects.

PS: If the color scheme of this site strains your eyes too much (you should take a break!), you can use <a href="/posts/atom.xml" type="application/atom+xml">RSS</a> with a comfortable reader for an enjoyable reading experience (I will strive to produce interesting articles!).

The theme of this blog originates from [riggraz](https://riggraz.dev/)'s [no style, please! Jekyll theme](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/), ported by [atgumx](https://github.com/atgumx/no-style-please) to Zola static page generation system written in Rust. Finally, I made some modifications based on it and released a new theme: [no-style-please](https://github.com/iGxnon/no-style-please), which is deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

I am very satisfied with the workflow of my current blog. Simply push markdown modifications to Github; Cloudflare Pages receives hook-triggered events and executes `zola build`; finally pushing it to the cloud for display on the blog - usually taking just a few minutes.

If you also like this theme, feel free to use it! It comes with additional features:

- Music notation support
- Katex support
- Multi-language
- Comment system (the current comment system is third-party Giscus with quite some CSS inconsistencies not aligned with the site's philosophy; expected change)
